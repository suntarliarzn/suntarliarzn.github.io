# Practice, Ethics & Integrity

<!--more-->

## 1. Documentation

- Critical for 2 things: 

  1. ### **Objective replication**

     - **Hypothesis**

       [^]: **Bold ones** are explicitly stated in  a research publication.

     - **Design**

     - **Prediction**

     - *Procedures*

       [^]: *Italic ones* are summarized.

     - *Instruments*

     - Contacting Participants

  2. ###  **Checking and verification of results and conclusions**

     - *Data*
     - *Data manipulation*
     - *Statistics*
     - **Interpretation**

- Available On line

  ### Instruments & materials

  the instruments used to measure or manipulate the variables of interest, and the procedures or instruments used to control or measure extraneous variables.

  - **written or verbal instructions**

  - **text used in email communications**

  - **consent forms**

  - **documents containing debriefing information**

  - **Instruments**

    1. how many questions a scale in a questionnaire
    2. what the response options are
    3.  what the range of possible scale scores is
    4.  an example item is often provided

  - **research protocol 实验流程方案**

    the order and manner in which materials or information were presented to the participants and  the way procedures were implemented.

    - the moment of first contact
    - how a participant is recruited with what information and by whom.
    - how consent is obtained
    - what instruction or information is given, in what order
    - what help is provided if participants don't understand instructions or they behave in an unexpected manner.
    - how participants are debriefed about the research after their participation.

  - preregistered 备案

  - pilot study

## 2. Data Management

1. ### Store

   - **code book**: information or metadata about what the variables mean.

     - what property each variable measures
     - what values mean
     - what the range of possible values is
     - **missing value**: what values are used to denote if participant did not supply relevant information

     ![](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/codebook.jpg)

   - **original data**

     - paper questionnaires filled out by participants
     - video material used for observational coding

   - duplicate files

2. ### Process

   - #### Recording

   - #### Computing sum scores

3. ### Analyze

   - #### Syntax file 语法文件

     **a simply programming file** that can be used to reproduce all the computations and statistical analyses at the push of a button.

     - checking and replicating results

## 3. Unethical studies

- Tuskegee syphilis study 塔斯基吉梅毒研究
- Guatemala study 危地马拉研究



## 4. Ethics towards participants

- Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) 伦理审查委员会

- Three Principles:

  1. ### Respect 尊重

     - Respect for the participant's autonomy.

       - Voluntary consent vs. Coercion
         - extremely large financial reward
         - special treatment to diseases
         - students for course credit

     - Consent form

     - Often, **some form of deception** is necessary to control for reactivity and demand characteristics.

       - **Omission**: the goal of the study is not stated or formulated in very general vague terms.

       - **Active deception**: a cover story.

       - **False feedback**

         - !!danger!!: perseverance effect 固化效应

           participants are still affected by the deception even after they're debriefed and the deception is revealed and explained to them.

  2. ### Beneficence 善行

     - the participants should not be harmed.
       - cost benefit analysis
         - individual level
         - broader level
       - invasion of participant's privacy
         - **solution**: anonymity of data should only be promised if identifying information is deleted.
         - who will have access?
         - what it will be used for?

  3. ###  Justice 公正

     - cost and benefits of research should be divided reasonably, fairly and equally over potential participants.

## 5. Research Integrity

- Openness, transparency and critical and systematic empirical testing.

- ### Fraud

  - data were either fabricated or falsified to provide false support for the researcher's hypothesis.

    - #### Fabrication 伪造

      - Data were never collected, but were made up.

    - #### Falsification 篡改

      - existing data were illegitimately altered

      

- ### Plagiarism

  - a substantial scientific contribution is presented as one's own by copying original text, concepts or data of others without referring to the original source.
    - new type of plagiarism---self-plagiarism 自我抄袭
      - 

- ### Conflicts of Interest

  - researches are funded by parties of interest.

- ### Personal Values

  - strong convictions or personal values can blind researchers to their data and valid critiques.

## 6. Questionable Research Practices

- Practices that are acceptable if they're implemented objectively and responsibly. **But they can be abused to obtain more favorable results.**

  ![](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/QRP.jpg)

  - ### Harking 事后假设

    - hypothesizing after the results are known
      - hypothesis is adapted to fit the observed data.
    - a **priori** hypothesis can be considered relatively strong support for a hypothesis
      - Prediction is much harder.
    - a **posteriori** hypothesis formed after the fact.
      - it's easy to find an explanation that fits a specific result.
      - the original hypothesis is not confirmed.

  - ### P-Hacking P值操纵

    - data manipulation or selection that makes the results(*p-value*) more favorable.
    - The golden rule of p-hacking is that **as long as data selection and manipulation are reported and arguments are provided, the reader can judge for himself whether these choices are justified.**

    ![](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/p%20hacking.jpg)

    - #### Cherry-picking 摘樱桃

      - reporting only results that are favorable and significant.

    - #### Selective Omission 选择性遗漏

      - the omission of non-significant results and results that contradict the hypothesis.

    - #### Data snooping 数据探测

      - the collection of data exactly until results show a favorable p-value.
      - sample size should be determined beforehand based on non-arbitrary estimates of the expected effect size of a treatment and the required confidence level

- **as long as choices are reported, they should be discussed and their influence on results can be evaluated.**



## 7.  Peer Review Process

## 8 Dissemination Problems

- Side effect: publication bias

  - favoring the publication of new and exciting significant results.

- file-drawer problem

  - it's more rewarding to do a new study in hope for positive results and leave the null results study in a file drawer.

- ### solutions:

  - preregistration of the research question, the design and statistical plan.
    - eliminate harking, cherry picking and selective omission.
  - basing the decision to accept or reject a manuscript on preregistered research proposals instead of completed studies.
    - eliminate publication bias and the file drawer problem.
  - the data and statistical analysis are made publicly available.
    - eliminate p-harking, fraud
