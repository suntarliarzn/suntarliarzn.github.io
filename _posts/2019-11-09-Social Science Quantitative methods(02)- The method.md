# Quantitative methods(02)  - The Scientific Method

<!--more-->

1. ## Empirical Cycle

   ![Empirical Cycle](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/empirical%20cycle.jpg)

   ```mermaid
   graph TB
   A[Observation]-->B[Hypothesis]
   B-->C[experiments]
   C-->D[Analysis&Result]
   D-->E[Evaluation: Hypothes supported, adjusted, or rejected]
   E-->A
   ```

   

   1. ### Observation

      - **function**: sparks idea for hypothesis(anything we want to explain):
        - pattern
        - unexpected event
        - interesting relation
      - **source**: not important:
        - personal
        - shared
        - imagined
        - previous research findings
      - **observing relation in one or more instances**

   2. ### Induction

      ```mermaid
      graph TB
      A[mutiple observation: true in specific cases] --> B[general rule: ture in all cases ]
      ```

      - general rule or hypothesis

   3. ### Deduction

      - hold true in new instances
      - expectation/prediction is deduced about new observations
      - determine research setup
      - define **concepts, measurement instruments, procedures, sample**
      - hypothesis is transformed with deductive reasoning and specification of research setup into **prediction about new observations**

   4. ### Testing

      - data collection
      - compare data to prediction
      - statistical processing
        - descriptive: summarize
        - inferential: decide

   5. ### Evaluation

      - Conclusion:
        1. Results confirm prediction--> Hypothesis provisionally supported
        2. Results disconfirm prediction--> Hypothesis not automatically rejected: 
           - repeat with better research setup(**empirical cycle**)
           - adjust hypothesis
           - reject hypothesis

2. ## Confirmation/Disconfirmation

   1. ### Confirmation

      - Prediction confirmed
      - Hypothesis not proven but **provisionally supported**
      - more support-->more credence

      > No scientific empirical statement can ever be proven once and for all.

   2. ### Disconfirmation

      - Prediction disconfirmed
        - Plausible explanations for  failure:
          1. methodological issues
          2. research design
          3. instruments inappropriate
          4. variables not controlled
      - Hypothesis
        - preserved
          - reject auxiliary assumptions on research design and measurement
          - come up with a better research setup
        - adjusted
          - by adding additional clauses
          - modified hypothesis less general
        - rejected/radically adjusted
          - very rare

3. ### Criteria for evaluation

   1. #### Reliability

      - Replicability: repetition possible

        

   2. #### Validity

      hypothesized relation accurately reflects reality

      - ##### Construct validity

        - prerequisite
        - **constructs measured/manipulated accurately**
        - **instruments measure/manipulate intended properties accurately**
        - biggest challenges！！！

      - ##### Internal validity

        - hypothesized causal relation
        - observed effect due to hypothesized cause
        - **threatened by: plausible alternative explanations**

      - ##### External validity

        - hypothesized relation holds in general?
        - results generalize to other people,groups,environments,times?

4. ## Causality

   - Hume first list the criteria:
     1. cause and effect are connected
     2. cause precedes effect
     3. cause and effect co-vary consistently
        - **correlation does not imply causation!**
     4. no alternative explanations
        - **the most difficult one!!!**
        - methodology to minimize the alternatives

5. ## Internal Validity Threats

   - ### Participants

           </video>
     
     - #### Maturation
     
  - alternative explanation: natural change 
       - **solution: control group**

     - #### Selection
     
  - alternative explanation: differences in participant characteristics
       - **solution: randomized selection**

     - #### Selection by maturation
     
  - alternative explanation: groups systematically differ in their rate of maturation 
         - selected groups become mature during the experiment
  - **solution: randomized assignment to groups**
     
   - ### Instruments
   
  - #### Low construct validity
   
    - systematic bias/measures another construct
       - prerequisite for internal validity
    - **solution:**
         - valid instruments
         - valid manipulation methods
         - used consistently
   
     - #### Instrumentation
   
    - instruments changed during the process of the study
       - **solution:**
      - valid instruments
         - valid manipulation methods
         - used consistently
   
     - #### Testing
   
    - sensitization: measurement affects behavior
       - **solution:**
      - special design with multiple groups with/without pretest
   
   - ### Artificiality
   
  expectation changes behaviors
   
  - #### Experimenter expectancy
   
    - Researcher changes behavior(unconsciously) biasing effect researcher's expectations
       - influences participants' responses
    - **solution: experimenter blind design**
   
     - #### Demand characteristics
   
    - Participant changes behavior(unconsciously)
   
      biasing effect participant's expectations
   
    - **Solution: leave participants unaware of the real purpose of the study or at least which group they are in**
   
      - **Double Blind Research Design**
   
    - **solution: cover story**
   
      - temporary deception-->needs to be necessary
         - risk of bias-->needs to be real
      - researcher--> needs to debrief participants afterwards
   
   - ### Research Setup
   
  - #### Ambiguous temporal precedence 时间先后模糊
   
    - **solution: manipulation of cause**
   
  - #### History
   
    - unforeseen event during study
       - provides alternative explanation
    - large-scale
         - **solution: unavoidable**
       - small-scale
         - **solution: test subjects separately, if possible**
   
     - #### Mortality
   
    - participants dropout
       - alternative explanation: differential dropout
    - **solution: hard to avoid; document reasons for dropout for further research**
   
6. ## Relevant types of variables

   1. ### Construct

      - denotes property in general, abstract terms
        - *loneliness&depression*

   2. ### Variable

      - operationalized, concrete expression of construct.

        - **measurable/manipulable**
        - *UNLA loneliness scale/ GDS depression survey*

      - **Vary+able!!**

      - **Types of variables**

        1. #### Independent variable

           - **In control of**
           - cause; explanatory; input; predictor

        2. #### Dependant variable

           -  **influenced by/the result of dependent**
           - effect; response; outcome; output

      - Variables of disinterest

        extraneous properties

        1. #### Confounders/ lurking variable

           潜在变数(Lurking variable):指对研究中其他变数间的关系有重要影响,却没有被列入研究范围的变数.（要么因为此存在变量不为人知,或者它的影响被认为是可以忽略而其实不能忽略,或者是数据无法获得） 

           - related to independent/dependent variables
           - partially or entirely accounts for relationship
           - **solution: keeping it constant or  turn it into control variable**

        2. #### Control variables

           - likely to be related to independent/dependent variables
           - effects can be controlled for (**unlike confounder**)
           - **solution: checking relationship at each level or value**

        3. #### Background variable

           - not relevant in relation between independent+dependent variable
           - relevant for determining representativeness:
             - age
             - gender
             - ethnic/cultural  background
             - social status
             - education level
           - **solution: change it into control variables**
           - used to assess generalizability
