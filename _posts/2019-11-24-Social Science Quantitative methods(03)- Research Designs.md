# Research Design

<!--more-->

## 1. True Experiments

Randomized control trials/RCT

Maximize internal validity

- 3 essential ingredients for true experiments:

  - ### Manipulation

    - cause under control
    - eliminate temporal precedence: **cause precedes effect**

  - ### Comparison

    - control group
    - ensures effect does not occur naturally: maturation

  - ### Random assignment

    - ensures there are no other explanations for the effect
    - **Replication**
      - is required to ensure randomization works

## 2. Factorial Design 析因设计 

- several independent variables--**factors**
  - investigated simultaneously
- one dependent variable

## 3. Repeated Measures

1. ### Between Factor 组间因素

   - the dependent variable measured after being exposed to the independent variable.
     - gender

2. ### Within Factor 组内因素

   - the dependent variable measured after being exposed to **each level** of the independent variable.

     - different level of dosages to one patient

   - #### Repeated measures design 重复测量设计

     - measured repeatedly
     - Short period
  - at least one within factor and one or more between factors
   
- #### Longitudinal design 纵向设计
  
     - measured repeatedly
     - long period of time
     - rare
     - mostly correlation studies
     - sometimes (quasi-) experimental studies

## 4. Research Control

1. ### Manipulation

   - control over independent variable

       - value/level determined by researcher

   - control over external variables

     - rule out alternative explanations

   - terms: **level;condition;group**

   - #### experimental variable

     - independent variable that can be fully controlled

   - #### individual difference variables

     - intrinsic property of participant that cannot be controlled
     - age/gender
     
   - ##### Seemingly non-manipulable variables that can be manipulated

       - ##### **a manipulation check**

       - ##### **measuring after the dependent effect variables**

2. #### Control of variables of disinterest

   ##### ideal: only difference: independent variables

   - ceteris paribus: all other things are equal

   - much harder in social science to control

   - Control variables

   - solution:  

     - #### Randomization随机化   

         eliminates all systematic differences between participants in different conditions on average

         - **Randomization failure:** unequal distribution possible

           - solution:

               1. **Randomization check:** measure relevant variables to check whether randomization worked and the conditions are the same.

               2. **Restricted randomization**（限制性随机）

                   guarantee randomization over selected variables

         - **blocking**（区组）: guarantees equal group sizes

           - pair participants in blocks of two
           - flip a coin to determine where the first participant goes
           - the second... participant is automatically assigned the other condition

         - stratified restricted randomization(分层限制性随机): equal distribution on participant  characteristic

           - boys/girls
           - sex
           - age

         - Limits:

           - \>2,3 variables-->too complicated
           - too many possibly relevant variables
           - Randomization with repeated measures

   - It is necessary!

   - avoiding maturation

     - counterbalancing: order randomized抵消平衡法
       - Within subject designs: **the order in which subjects are exposed to the conditions should be randomized.**
       - Subjects are assigned to one out of all possible orderings of the conditions possibly using blocking to ensure that no one ordering is over represented.列出所有可能的实验条件序列 并将受试者分配到每一组 尽量使用区组来确保各组人数相当

3. #### Matching

   - Random assignment impossible?
     - threat of selection to internal validity
     - pragmatic/ethical reasons
     - independent variable-->individual differences variable
   - **Matching on relevant background variables**
   - **Threat: undermatching**
     - measured with some error
     - related to the variables of interest
     - **Due to regression to the mean!(均值回归)**
       - 选择的对象没有代表性导致重复试验时向均值回归。
     - detrimental effect!

## 5. Lab vs Field

- #### Lab

  - often experimental
  - maximizes internal validity
  - low ecological validity? mundane  realism?
    - not similar to natural setting
    - Low ecological validity doesn't imply low construct validity or low external validity
  - experimental realism
    - experimental translation of natural setting

- #### Field 

  - often non-experimental
  - maximize external validity
  - uncontrolled environment
  - often observing natural behavior

## 6. Experimental Designs

1. ### Two-group Design双组设计

   - Experimental group: the hypothesized cause is present

   - Control group: the cause is absent

   - **Two-group pretest/post-test design**

     ![](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/two%20prougs%20pre-post%20test.jpg)

     - avoid maturation
     - compare the size of the increase or decrease in scores

   - pretest

     - sensitize 被试敏感化
     - practice effect 练习效应
       - higher score in post-test
     - alert participants to the purpose of the study

2. ### Solomon four-group design 所罗门四组设计

   - two group design+ two group pre/post-test design

     ![](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/solomon%204%20gropu.jpg)

     - the experimental/control condition are run twice
       - one with a pretest
       - one without a pretest
     - avoid practice effect

3. ### Repeated measure design with one within subject factor 单一主体因素重复测量设计

   -  all participants are exposed to all levels of the independent variable. They experience all conditions.

   ![](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/repeated%20measure%20design%20within%20one%20factor.jpg)

## 7. Quasi-experimental designs

- **non random assignment**

  - random assignment can be: impractical/unethical

- sometimes no manipulation, or comparison

  - individual differences variable: non-manipulable
    - sex
    - disease

- **investigates causal relation**

- natural event/natural experiment

- values selected, not manipulated 

  - like correlational studies
  - difference: 准实验研究检验的是因果假说 且会尽可能地极力控制额外变量.

- ### Types of designs

  1. #### Static groups comparison

     [Static groups comparison](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/stactic%20groups%20comparison.jpg)

     - similar to the two group experimental design
     - a post-test after exposure to the independent variable
     - Difference: Non random assignment
       - internal selection threat
       - Comparison of groups lessens the threats of maturation and history

  2. #### Pre/post-test Non-equivalent control group 不等组前测-后测设计

     [Pre/post-test Non-equivalent control group](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/pre%20post%20non-equivalent%20control%20group.jpg)

     - firmly disambiguate the causal order
     - assess the size of any maturation effects
     - not always possible to use in control group

  3. #### One group pre/post-test  单组前测-后测设计

  4. #### Interrupted time-series design 中断时间序列设计

     ![interrupted time-series design](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/interrupted%20time-series%20design.jpg)

     - more observations/ tests before and after the treatment

     - avoid maturation

     - still history threat

       - solution:

         - replicated interrupted time-series design

           - control group
           - pre/post-test non-equivalent control group with more tests :smile:

         - redo the experiment at a different time

           ![redo the experiement](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/redo%20interrupted%20time-series.jpg)


## 8 Correlational design相关性研究

- no manipulation of independent variable

- or no independent variable identified

- no causal direction specified

- **don't select/manipulate just measure**

- ### types:

  ![correlational design](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/correlation%20design.jpg)

  1. #### Cross sectional design 横断面实验设计

     - **one large group is considered at one specific point of time**
     - a fairly large number of properties are measured at once
     - aim: to investigate the association between variables in a way that accurately describes a larger population
     - survey study or survey design

  2. #### time-series design 时间序列设计

     - **one person is measured at several points in time, usually with many measurement moments in quick succession and in fixed intervals.**

       - ##### longitudinal design vs. time-series vs. repeated measures

         - ###### longitudinal 

           - general term for measuring repeatedly over long period of time

         - ###### time-series

           - **correlational**: 1 person measured over time
           - **quasi-experimental**: people in conditions measured repeatedly
           - **experimental:** N=1 study: 1 person measured over time in all conditions

         - ###### repeated measures

           - experimental: persons measured over time in all conditions where
           - one or more independent variables are manipulated

  3. #### Panel design 群组实验设计

     - also call time-series cross-sectional design(TSCS)
     - the same group of people is measured at several points in time
       - cohort design 队列实验设计
         - a special case of panel design
         - participants are all same age or started a new school or a job at the same time
