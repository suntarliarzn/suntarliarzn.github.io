# Measurement

<!--more-->

## 1. Operationalization

- Variable

  - operationalized construct
  - still somewhat abstract

- ### Operationalization

  - **Specific, concrete method** to measure/manipulate a construct.
  
  - Operationalization means **selection or creation of a specific procedure to measure or manipulate the construct of interest**.
  
  - An operationalization makes it possible to assign people **an actual score on the variable of interest**.
  
    ![example of operationalization](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/example%20of%20operatinalization.jpg)
  
  - An operationalization doesn't necessarily capture or represent the construct in its entirety.
  
  - Keep in mind **what aspect of the construct the operationalization actually measures or manipulates.**

## 2. Measurement

- Measurement Structure

  - What information is (not) captured with numbers?

- ### Definition

  - **measurement is representation of relations between objects on a property with relations between numbers.**测量是指通过运用数字间的关系来表现物体、人或群体间具有的某种属性之间的关系。
  - the relation:
    - differentiate
    - order
    - compare differences
    - compare ratios

    ![measurement](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/measurement.jpg)

- Measurement levels

  - ### Nominal 定类排列（主观分类）

    - categorize the values
    - distinguish between values(inequality)
    - only differentiate values
    - eg.: nationality, sex, pet preference

  - ### Ordinal 定序排列（主观排列组合）

    - ordering of values
    - **oder difference does not determine the quantitative differences. **
    - eg.: math ability
      - differences or ratios of scores don't reflect differences or ratios of math ability

  - ### Interval Variable 定距变量（主观定量）

    - not only distinguish order values, but also to **interpret differences between values**.
    - eg.: temperature
      - can not say water at 80F is twice as hot as water at 40F because **the zero point of temperature is arbitrarily defined**.
      - Celsius 0 = fresh water freezes vs. Fahrenheit 0 = brine freezes
      - The value zero doesn't correspond to the absence of temperature.

  - ### Ratio variable 定比变量(客观定量)

    - The zero length is the same whether you measure in inches or in centimeters.
    - rare in social science

  - the structure of a property doesn't have to be fully captured by a measurement instrument.

## 3. Variable Types

![](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/types%20of%20variable.jpg)

1. ### Categorical分类变量

   - unordered(nominal)/ordered(ordinal)

   - number of categories

     - #### dichotomous/binary: 2

       - male/female
       - under 20/ 20 above

     - #### polytomous: more than 2

   - distance between values uninterpretable

   - **Intepretation**: frequency(频数)；mode(众数)；median(中位数)

2. ### Quantitative定量变量

   - reflects inequality,order and extent of differences
   - interval/ratio

3. #### Continuous/Discrete variable连续/离散变量

   ![](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/discrete%20continous.jpg)

   1. #### Continuous

      - always find value between any other two values

   2. #### Discrete

      - limited set of values
        1. nominal/ordinal
           - always discrete by nature
        2. quantitative
           - can also be discrete

## 4. Measurement Validity

1. ### Face Validity 表面效度

   - expert assessment
   - *experts can be wrong*

2. ### Predictive/Criterion validity 预测效度/效标效度

   - Instrument predicts relevant property
   - Something is measured consistently
   - *not necessarily intended construct*
   - *the ability to predict something doesn't mean the scores used for prediction accurately reflect the intended construct.*

3. ### Gold standard

   - already had a valid instrument for the property of interest.
   - administer both instruments and see whether the scores on the new scale agreed with the already validated scale.
   - *there aren't many gold standard instruments for social and psychological constructs.*

4. ### Direct empirical verification 定量测试效度

   - *For social and psychological constructs, no undisputed, direct way to determine whether one person is more intelligent.*

5. ### Convergent/discriminant validity 收敛/区别效度

   - seeing whether the scores relate to similar and different variables in a way that we expect.观察其得分与相似以及不同变量的关系是否符合预期。

   - 多重检验+反证法

   - #### Multi-trait multi-method matrix approach（MTMM） 多元特质多重方法矩阵法

     - different instruments to measure different traits

     ![MTMM](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/multitrait%20mutimethod%20matrix.jpg)

## 5.  Measurement Reliability

   - the instrument's consistency, stability or precision

   - types:

     1. ### test-retest 

        - not applicable to the memory test

     2. ###  internal consistency

        - look at the consistency between different parts of the instrument at one time
        - **split-halves reliability**
          - randomly splitting the tests in half and assess the association between the first and second half.
          - there are also statistics that are equivalent to the average of all possible ways to split the test.
            - [Cronbach's alpha](https://statistics.laerd.com/spss-tutorials/cronbachs-alpha-using-spss-statistics.php)
            - [WHAT DOES CRONBACH’S ALPHA MEAN?](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/spss/faq/what-does-cronbachs-alpha-mean/)
        - if measurement consists of observation instead of self-report:
          - **intra observer reliability**: the same observer rate twice and assess the association between the two assessments.
            - *the memory of the observer can inflate the association*
          - **inter rater reliability**: two different people observe and rate the behavior and look at the association between the two rater's scores.
     
   - ### Systematic error

     - systematically measure an additional construct
       - cat fondness scale + general positive attitude?
     - less valid but not less reliable

   - ### Random error

     - error that's entirely due to chance: random fluctuations / noise

   - ### Reliability&Validity

     - reliability required for validity
     - validity not require for reliability
     - 一个测量方法必须有一定可靠性，进而才能是有效的 反之则不成立 。
     - 一个非常可靠的测量方法也可能是完全无效的，当它完美测量的并不是应该测量的建构时，这一情况就会发生。

## 6. Survey Questionnaire Test

- ### Surveys

  - ask for different types of information
  - covers different topics

- ### Questionnaire

  - measures one/related constructs
  - psychological traits, emotional states or attitudes

- ### Test

  - measures ability

- Components

  1. a clear instruction

     - cover story

  2.  Interviewers/ on-line application

  3. items 题目

     ![](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/item.jpg)

     - a series of questions

  4. stem 题干

     - questions, statements or words that a participant has to respond
     - respond options: discrete options or a continuous range

  5. scale 尺度

     - items measure the same construct or the same aspect of a construct
     - subscale分量表

  6. sumscore 总分

     - indicates a person's value on the property

## 7. Scales and Response Options

- ### Likert scale

  - summative scale

  - items measure the same property

  - monotone单一维度： higher score = higher value on property

  - scale construction

    ![scale construction](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/scale%20construction.jpg)

    ![scale](https://suntarliarzn-1258316859.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/social%20science/01%20quatitative%20methods/scale.jpg)

  - items should be

    1. **well formulated = short and simple 问题简短**
    2. **unambiguous: avoid double-barrelled questions 避免一题多义**
    3. **not suggestive 中立**
       - :no_entry_sign:*don't you think...?*
    4. **answerable可回答**
       - :+1:a filter question in advance
    5. **avoid extreme wording避免极端词汇**
       - :no_entry_sign:*words like never or always*

  - response options should be

    1. **unambiguous没有歧义**
    2. **consistent前后一致**
    3. **exhaustive详尽**
       - all respondents should be able to reflect their position on the property 所有受试者都可以找到一个反映他们立场的答案
    4. **mutually exclusive互斥**

- other types of rare scales

  - differential scale 差异量表
    - allow for non-monotone items
  - cumulative scale 累积量表
    - items themselves show consistent ordering
    - each item expressing the property more strongly than the previous one

## 8. Response and Rater Bias

- There is always some degree of systematic errors or bias.

- Response sets反应定势/ response styles反应风格

  - Self-report bias

    - ### acquiescence

      - the tendency to agree with all statements regardless of their content
      - **solution: include some negatively phrased items**

    - ### social desirability

      - the responses of people who tend to present themselves more favorably or in more socially acceptable ways.
      - occur if a scale measures a property that's considered socially sensitive or relevant to someone's self image.
      - **solution: adding social desirability items such as I've never stolen anything in my life or I've never lied to anyone. **
        - If people strongly agree with these items, there's a fair chance that their responses to other questions are biased towards responses that are more socially acceptable.

    - ### extreme response style

      - respondents don't want to think about exactly how strongly they agree or disagree with an item. They'll choose the most extreme options.
      - unlike acquiescence bias, participants' responses are consistent, nut just more extreme than their true value.

    - ### bias towards the middle

      - respondents tend to choose a less extreme response option.
      - **solution: include some extremely strong items such as cats are purely evil creatures.**
        - if they respond with a middle category to all items, including these extremely worded items, their response pattern is inconsistent.

  - Observer Rating

    - ### halo effect 光环效应

      - positivity/negativity on one dimension spills over to other dimensions
        - *eg. more attractive people are rated more intelligent or better at their job.*

    - ### generosity errors 慷慨评价误差

    - ### severity errors 严格评价误差

## 9. Other Measurement Types

- ### Physical measurements生理测量

  - medicine/biology/psychology
    - skin conductance皮肤电导率-->arousal觉醒状态
    - eye tracking--> focus of attention
    - EEG脑电图/FMRI核磁共振成像-->brain/cognitive activity

- ### Observation 观测法

  - sociology/psychology/educational sciences
    - careful registration of specific behavior
    - employ coding schemes that specify categories of behavior and their criteria
      - what the behavior in each category looks like
      - how long it should be displayed
      - under what circumstances it should occur
      - time frame 编码时间
  - training of observers
    - under they show enough agreement when coding the same material

- ### Trace measurement 痕迹测量

  - assess behavior indirectly through physical trace evidence
    - *eg.: counting the number of used tissues after a therapy session to represent how depressed a client is.* 

- ### Archival data 归档数据

  - a property can be represented with measurements that were already collected by others
    - *eg.: census data* 

- ### Content analysis 内容分析

  - structured coding of elements in a text
  - Computer software can code very complicated schemes.

- ### Interviewing 访谈

  - Structured
    - questions/ question order/ response options are predetermined
    - similar to survey
    - hard to get unbiased answers to sensitive questions
  - Unstructured/open
    - a qualitative method
    - procedure:
      1. start off with a general topic
      2.  a set of points to be addressed
      3.  but the interview is not limited to these points
      4.  questions are open ended
    - disadvantages:
      - the conversation can lead anywhere
      - differ per respondent --> aggregation more difficult
    - other qualitative methods 
      - **case study**
      - **focus groups**
      - **oral histories**
      - **participatory observation**
      - **...**
